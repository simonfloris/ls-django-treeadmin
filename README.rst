ls-django-treeadmin
===================

ls-django-treeadmin is a complement to models that are
`django-mptt`_-enabled. It provides a drag-&-drop interface to modify the
tree.

It was originally developed as part of `FeinCMS`_. They deserve all the
kudos for this.

This version is a fork of `piquadrat`'s version, updated for django 1.7,
and Python 3 as well.
